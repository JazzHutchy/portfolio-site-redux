    <p>Hackathon Project: Eatup</p>
    <p>Users of the site sign up and create a profile. They set their preferences of what food they want to eat on a particular
        day and they get matched up with other people who want to eat the same cuisine. From there, users can send messages
        to each other to arrange a meetup at a eating venue (could also potentially double as a dating app).</p>

    <p>JH BI-FI</p>
    <p>A 2-sided online electronics marketplace, users can advertise their electronic goods and trade with other users who are
        interested in buying said goods.</p>
