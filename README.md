# Portfolio-Site-Redux

A redo of my first portfolio site.

I was less than impressed with my previous portfolio website, so I wanted to give it another shot.

Now deployed!

## Audience

For potential employers, potential partners and anyone with enough curiousity.

# Design Decisions

## Inspirations

One of the biggest problems I faced with my previous attempt at building a site was my motivation to actually construct it. I felt like I was being dishonest with myself by trying to pick colours and themes

Because gaming is one of my long-time hobbies, I thought I should base my site on gaming product websites:

* Razer: https://www2.razerzone.com/au-en
* Epic Gear: https://www.epicgear.com/en/news
* Mad Katz: http://www.madcatz.com/

Decided that the site should be based off the razer colour scheme (ie. black, white, grey, green).

## Usability Heuristics

* Was initially thinking of trying a multi-page website, but most likely going to scrap the idea as it doesn't offer the best UX given the level of content. Created a seperate branch for both, just in case.
* My site will have a navbar to quickly access all part of the site, including home, about, skills and portfoilio pages.
* There should easy access to downloading my resumes on every page of the site.
* After a long hiatus, I have picked up Javascript as part of my coding repotoire. I intend to use it to create dynamic features for my website.

# Challenges

* Idea to redesign the site started directly after I finished my presentation, but I held off my motivation to actually doing the redesign until much later.
* CSS was quite time-consuming, but that is to be somewhat expected.
* I didn't know any javascript when I began the redesign, I am now attempting to learn more about it to enchance the features of my site.

# Ongoing Improvements

* Use of Javascript in the website, I am learning jQuery and I hope to enhance the look and feel of the site using it.
* Potentially more CSS effects where appropriate and easier to implement than Javascript.
* I would like to add an flashy animation to my logo that doesn't assault visitor's eyes too badly (probably with clever CSS/JS). Need to read up on how to interact with SVGs.
* I need to obtain more photos of myself and add them to a carousel or a similar display medium.
