# portfolio-site-redux
A redo of my first portfolio site.

I was less than impressed with my previous portfolio website, so I wanted to give it another shot.

# Audience
For potential employers, potential partners and anyone with enough curiousity.

## Inspirations
One of the biggest problems I faced with my previous attempt at building a site was my motivation to actually construct it. I felt like I was being dishonest with myself by trying to pick colours and themes

Because gaming is one of my long-time hobbies, I thought I should base my site on gaming product websites:

- Razer: https://www2.razerzone.com/au-en

- Epic Gear: https://www.epicgear.com/en/news
- Mad Katz: http://www.madcatz.com/

## Usability Heuristics
- Was initially thinking of trying a multi-page website, but most likely going to scrap the idea as it doesn't offer the best UX given the level of content. Created a seperate branch for both, just in case.
- My site will have a navbar to quickly access all part of the site, including home, about, skills and portfoilio pages.
- There should easy access to downloading my resumes on every page of the site.
- After a long hiatus, I have picked up Javascript as part of my coding repotoire. I intend to use it to create dynamic features for my website.
