    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there!</p>
    <p>My name is Jared Hutchinson. I graduated uni with a Bachelor of Commerce, I am currently studying a Diploma of IT at
        Coderacademy, Melbourne.
    </p>
    <p>Iâ€™m not droning away in front of a computer screen, I love exercise, travelling, video games and drowning myself in copious
        quantities of coffee.</p>
    <p>The idea of taking up IT seemed logical, as I had surrounded myself with computers growing up. I never greatly understood
        their intricacies and I was curious to understand the technology that I was accustomed to using every day.</p>
    <p>Please enjoy your stay. If you're interested in working together feel free to hit me up!</p>
